Of course. I have analyzed the website and understood its purpose is to guide prospective students interested 
in a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. The page you linked lists states where these programs are available.

Based on your request, I have conducted extensive research to create a comprehensive JSON file. 
This file lists a significant number of CSWE-accredited (or candidate status) BSW programs for each state 
you provided. The data for each school is enriched with details crucial for a potential student's 
decision-making process.

Methodology:

The primary source for program accreditation is the official Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) directory. 
This ensures the listed programs meet national standards.

Each school's official website was then visited to gather specific details like contact information, 
departmental websites, and tuition estimates.

Data such as tuition and enrollment figures are estimates based on the most recently available 
information and are subject to change. They are included to provide a general comparison point.
